PSK modulation/demodulation on simulink: In this project we'll try to simulate the PSK encoding/decoding process for real time application, the objective is to transmit wirelessly a binary in a noisy canal, restore the signal with a strong analog Chebychev filter and a comparator system....

What is this?
This project is an exhaustive README template that you can customize to your needs.
You can either add sections you like or remove sections you don't like. But you have
every time an example in front of you, from which you can derive from.

Why should I use this?
There are many README templates out there so why this one? The two main reasons for this are
that they contain often too little content or they are not easy to read or navigate through.

Getting Started
So how do you get this template to work for your project? It is easier than you think.

Requirements

Have a project ready where you can add a README
Basic knowledge of Markdown (here is a Cheatsheet)


Install
Use git to clone this repository into your computer.

git clone https://gitlab.com/kopino4-templates/readme-template



Usage
Use the well known command to copy the template

# Copy the content
CTRL + C

# Pase into your project
CTRL + V



Here is where it's your turn
Here starts the main content of your README. This is why you did it for in the first place.
To describe to future users of this project (including yourself) everything they need to know
to be able to use it and understand it.
Use visuals to help the reader understand better. An image, diagram, chart or code example says
more than thousand words


Don't forget anything
Think hard about anything that is clear to you but might not be clear for others. Why are you
using this aproach or why did you pick this solution instead?

Used technologies
For sure mention all the technologies you used. If the technologies age in time you don't forget
they are used and need to be replaced.

Testing
No tests no sucess. You SHOULD have tests for every project, but do new users know how to run them?

Logging
Logging is essential. How do you know something went wrong if the computer doesn't tell you? Logs
are the first place to search for bugs. Explain to everybody how you can customize it or used it
in the right way.

Contribute
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

Conclusion
